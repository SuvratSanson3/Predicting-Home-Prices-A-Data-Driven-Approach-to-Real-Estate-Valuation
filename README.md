📊 House Price Prediction

🔹 Project Workflow: House Price Prediction

1️⃣ Dataset Overview

Dataset Size: Houses sold in 2016 with various attributes.

Features:

Independent Variables:

Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Living area, Lot area, Number of floors, Waterfront, Number of views, Condition, Grade, Area of the house, Area of Basement, Built year, Renovation year, Postal code, Living area after renovation, Lot area after renovation, Schools nearby, Distance from the airport.

Dependent Variable: Price (House sale price).

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

📌 Descriptive Analysis:

Summarized the dataset to understand distributions and relationships.

📌 Data Cleaning:

Identified and removed missing or erroneous values.

📌 Outlier Treatment:

Capped outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

3️⃣ Regression Analysis Workflow

🔍 A. Assumptions Check for Linear Regression

Verified key assumptions:

✅ Linearity

✅ Homoscedasticity

✅ Independence of errors

✅ Normality of residuals

✅ Absence of multicollinearity (treated using Variance Inflation Factor).
